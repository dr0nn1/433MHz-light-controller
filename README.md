# 433MHz-light-controller
Turns on and off the light in a wardrobe if a door is open with help off a 433MHz sender and two IR-sensors too see if a door is open.
Hope my parents like that the light turns on automatic instead of using a stupid remote controller for turning the light on and off.

IR-sensors used:
Sharp GP2Y0A21 IR Distance Sensor (10-80cm) 
[Sensor](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32440560378.html?spm=a2g0s.9042311.0.0.1af74c4duRqzf8)

433MHz sender:
Used the receiver  for decoding the info from the remote controller.
Used the sender for toogle the light.
